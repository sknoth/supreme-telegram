Logic:
1. The admin/expert setups the scenario for the game (Scenario Object,Patient Object has been created)
2. The game has been created (Game object, Result Object has been created, Game Object has been updated with scenario ObjectId and result ObjectId)
3. User starts to login (User object has been created, Game Object has been updated with the user's ObjectId)
